# mooBotU

AU MIDI Controllable Synthesizer Plug-In. Default is in 32 bit but this can be changed in the Juce Projects settings under debug/release.


To build this AU plug-in, open up the project in Juce then run the code in X-code. Open up plug-in called mooBot in any DAW that supports AU plug-ins.

Change the sliders to control vibrato, resonant filter amount, Wah speed, and envelope and reverb.
